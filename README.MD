## Tradingview websockets integration
Unofficial library to interact with websockets on Tradingview.

P.S. Check out this awesome trading journal app https://tradinglog.app.

## Features
- Realtime data from Tradingview
- Authorization with session id from cookies
- Fetching candlesticks for any symbol with any available timeframe

## Example

### Getting candles 
here is an example when you want to get a candle with a one-time function this function returns a candle that matches the symbol you provide
```ts
import { connect, getCandles } from 'tradingview-ws'

(async function() {
  const connection = await connect()
  const candles = await getCandles({
    connection,
    symbols: ['FX:AUDCAD', 'FX:AUDCHF'],
    amount: 10_000,
    timeframe: 60
  })
  await connection.close()
  console.log(`Candles for AUDCAD:`, candles[0])
  console.log(`Candles for AUDCHF:`, candles[1])
}());
```

### Subscribe With Symbol
The following is an example of subscribing to some of the symbols that you follow. You have to send a callback to find out which symbols you are subscribing for

```ts
import { connect, connectAndSubscribe } from 'tradingview-ws'

(async function () {
  try {
    for (const iterator of ["SOLUSDT", "BTCUSDT"]) {
      const connection = await connect()
      connectAndSubscribe({
        connection,
        symbols: [iterator],
        amount: 1,
        timeframe: 1,
        callback: (event) => {
          console.log(event)
        }
      })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}());
```


## API

### `connect(options: ConnectionOptions = {}): Promise<TradingviewConnection>`

Creates new connection to tradingview websockets. Returns `TradingviewConnection`.

Options:

* `sessionId?: string` - authorize connection if present. Can be received from cookies.

### `getCandles({ connection, symbols, amount, timeframe = 60 }: GetCandlesParams)`

Fetches all available candles for symbols. The maximum amount is around 13_000 candles for the hourly timeframe. Returns an array where each element is an array of candles for one symbol in the order it passed to the function.

Options:

* `connection: TradingviewConnection` - connection object
* `symbols: string[]` - array of symbols. Symbol name can be found on Symbol info modal(click three dots after symbol name on the top left corner of the chart).
* `timeframe?: number | '1D' | '1W' | '1M'` - candlestick timeframe, default is `60`
* `amount?: number` - amount of candles to fetch. If not present, it will try to fetch as much as possible.

### `TradingviewConnection`

Connection object. Can be used directly to receive and send data to websockets.

Methods:

* `subscribe: (handler: Subscriber) => Unsubscriber` - subscribe to websockets events
* `send: (name: string, params: any[]) => void` - send command to websockets
* `close: () => Promise<void>` - close the connection
